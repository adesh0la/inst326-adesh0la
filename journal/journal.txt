Week 1 
This week I used AI on the exercises in order to reiterate and remember certain python functions that I had forgotten how to use. Using this method provided me with adequate examples that helped me with the exercises. I used it on a few questions to debug and clarify that I was following the directions correctly when unclear. Here is my AI chat link: https://claude.ai/chat/15ba2f8a-596f-4d3f-a589-29b7284599b6

I have yet to use AI on my team project due to us being so early into the process and it not being needed. 

I used Claude.AI for the first time after my professor recommended it. I do agree that that Claude is so much better for code compared to ChatGPT. ChatGPT would drag out code and make many mistakes that wouldn't occur if using Claude from the start. I compared the two with the same question and preferred the explanation given by Claude much more. I believe I will continue to use this AI in the future rather than ChatGPT.

Week 2 

This week I continued to use Claude.AI on the exercises in order to learn and remember how to use specific functions.

Some examples are the pop and sort function. These can be extremely useful for our project when trying to remove and sort data alphabetically. 

I think I am starting to prefer Claude.AI over ChatGPT due to the knowledge it has on programming and code. It is extremely useful and can be used to provide us with explanations. I think I will continue to use this on exercises and the project in the future. 

week 3 

This week the exercises took me significantly longer. The 30 exercises were a bit difficult and while I did use AI for problems where I had major issues, I tried to stay away from it.

I also used AI on questions where I did not understand the debugging. AI helped explain the error and how I could fix it in order to make my code more efficient. 

I am still using Claude.AI over ChatGPT because of how much more efficient it is when it comes to code and computing. 

week 4 
This week I refrained as much as possible from using AI. I want to start learning how to actually do the code on my own so I only use Claude.AI for debugging and explanation of the directions. 

I enjoyed working with classes and objects and I understand how they can be useful when it comes to storing information and retrieving said information. 

week 5 
This week I limited my use of AI on the week 5 exercise assignment.

I used Claude AI and a little bit of ChatGPT in order to debug or understand specific functions and how they are used in the code 

week 6
This week I used Claude in order to understand certain functions and how they are used. 

I use AI in order to generate examples that will better increase my understanding of specific topics when it comes to oop.
